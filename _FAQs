**Prospective/ Licensed Insolvency Practitioners**
<br><br>
**1.	Am I required to hold an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence in order to continue to administer insolvency or debt-restructuring cases which had commenced under the Bankruptcy Act or Companies Act after the commencement of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018?**
<br><br>
No. You can continue to act in the cases for which you were appointed under the Bankruptcy or Companies Acts prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018.  The requirement to hold a valid Insolvency Practitioner’s licence will only apply to cases commenced under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018.
<br><br>
**2.	Am I required to hold an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence to be appointed to act in cases commenced under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018?**
<br><br>
Yes, you are required to hold a valid Insolvency Practitioner’s licence in order to be appointed to act in insolvency or debt-restructuring cases commenced under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“The Act”). Failure to do so would constitute an offence under section 48(2) of the Act.

Section 527(1) of the Act, however, provides a 6-month transitional period effective from <implementation date of IRDA>, that allows you to undertake insolvency or debt-restructuring work commenced under the Act in the absence of an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence, and provided that you possess the necessary qualifications to do the same under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) and / or Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20)

At the end of the transitional period, you must hold an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence before you are allowed to undertake new appointments, or continue acting in your appointment as an insolvency practitioner in insolvency or debt-restructuring cases commenced under the Act. You are therefore advised to submit your application for an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence early to avoid contravening the requirements of the Act.
<br><br>
**3.	I am currently a trustee in bankruptcy / an approved liquidator acting as an insolvency practitioner in relation to an individual or a corporation. Will I automatically be given an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence or be deemed as a licensed Insolvency Practitioner?**
<br><br>
No. You will need to apply and hold an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence to be recognised as an approved Insolvency Practitioner. This is notwithstanding that you are currently a trustee in bankruptcy or an approved liquidator under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20) and Companies Act (Cap. 50).
<br><br>
**4.	What will happen to the cases for which I am currently appointed if my application is not approved?**
<br><br>
In the event that your application for a licence is not successful, you will no longer be able to continue to act as an Insolvency Practitioner for insolvency or debt-restructuring cases for which you accepted appointments where these cases were commenced under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018. You will be committing an offence if you continue administering these cases without a valid licence.
The vacancy in the appointment arising from the inability to obtain a licence will need to be filled according to the relevant provisions in the Act.
<br><br>
**5.	How and where do I submit my application for an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence?**
<br><br>
Please submit your application for an Insolvency Practitioner’s licence via the Government’s GoBusiness Licensing portal (hyperlink). You may also refer to our Licence Application Guide here (hyperlink) on the Application Process for more information on the steps and documents required to submit your application.
<br><br>
**6.	How long will it take for my application to be processed?**
<br><br>
We will take about 14 working days to process your application.  Please note that the processing time may be extended if the documents submitted in support of an application are not in order. 
<br><br>
**7.	How will I receive my Insolvency Practitioner’s licence?**
<br><br>
A copy of the insolvency practitioner’s licence will be sent to you by post and email if your application is successful.
<br><br>
**8.	When am I required to submit my application for a renewal of my Insolvency Practitioner’s licence? What happens if I miss the period to submit my renewal application?**
<br><br>
The Insolvency Practitioner’s licence will only be opened for renewal in the period commencing 1 March and ending 30 April of the expiry year. Please note that a fresh new application (application fee of $650) would have to be submitted instead if you miss the renewal application period. 
<br><br>
You are therefore advised to renew your licence early during the renewal window period.
