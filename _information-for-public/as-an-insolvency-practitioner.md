**As an Insolvency Practitioner** <br>
---
Under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“IRDA”), an insolvency practitioner’s licence is required if a person wishes to undertake the following appointment(s):
<br><br> 
* Liquidator or provisional liquidator of the corporation;
<br>
* Judicial manager or interim judicial manager of the corporation;
<br>
* Receiver or manager of the property of the corporation (being a company);
<br>
* Receiver or manager of the property in Singapore of a corporation (not being a company);
<br>
* Trustee of a bankrupt’s estate; or
<br>
* Nominee of a voluntary arrangement. 
<br><br>

Section 48(1) of the IRDA prohibits any person from acting as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a corporation or an individual, or advertising, or in any way holding out, that he or she is willing to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to a corporation or an individual without a licence. Any person found contravening or acting to the contrary shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
<br><br>
An insolvency practitioner’s licence is **not** required if a person:
<br><br>
a) wishes to be appointed as a liquidator in a members’ voluntary winding up case, or a scheme manager in a scheme of arrangement case commenced under the IRDA; or
<br>
b) intends to **only** administer insolvency or debt restructuring cases which had commenced under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20) and / or Companies Act (Cap. 50).
<br><br>
**Transition to the IRDA**
<br><br>
Section 527(1) of the IRDA provides a 6-month transitional period (effective from 30 July 2020 to 30 January 2021) that allows a person to undertake insolvency or debt restructuring work commenced under the Act **without holding an insolvency practitioner’s licence**, whilst his application for an insolvency practitioner's licence is being considered by the Licensing Officer. This is **provided** that he possesses the necessary qualifications to do the same under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) and / or Bankruptcy Act (Cap. 20):
<br><br>
**Scenario 1:** If you are an approved liquidator registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA") but not a public accountant, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in winding up and receivership cases commenced under the IRDA.
<br>
 
**Scenario 2:** If you are a public accountant, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in judicial management, bankruptcy and voluntary arrangement cases commenced under the IRDA.
<br> 

**Scenario 3:** If you are a qualified solicitor, you will only be allowed to undertake appointments in bankruptcy or voluntary arrangement cases commenced under the IRDA.
<br><br>
A person who intends to undertake insolvency officeholder appointments under the IRDA should submit his licence application early and within the transitional period with the Licensing Officer to avoid acting without a valid insolvency practitioner's licence.
<br><br>
At the end of the transitional period, a person who has undertaken such insolvency officeholder appointments in the transitional period must ensure that he holds a valid insolvency practitioner’s licence to undertake new and / or continue acting in existing insolvency or debt restructuring appointments commenced under the IRDA.
